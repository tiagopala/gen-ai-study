# Introduction

## What is Generative AI?

### How it works?

The core principles and progress in AI technology, particularly in text generation using **generative AI** and its base in supervised learning, can be summarized through the following key points:

**Generative AI's**: The excitement surrounding Gen AI can be attributed to recent significant advancements in AI, particularly in supervised learning and the emergence of prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is now recognized as one of the most crucial tools in AI, especially for business applications.

**Supervised Learning** is a technology that allows computers to generate a specific output (B) from an input (A).

Examples include spam detection, online advertising, self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, manufacturing defect inspection, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis of reviews.

**Evolution of Supervised Learning**: The period around 2010-2020 is identified as crucial for large-scale supervised learning, which laid the foundation for modern generative AI. 
The effectiveness of large AI models depends on the quantity of data used to train them.

**Relationship between LLMs for Text Generation**: LLMs are typically constructed using supervised learning, where they generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence. This requires training on hundreds of billions or even more than a trillion words to enhance accuracy and versatility in generating text based on prompts.

In summary, large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI tools like ChatGPT can boost productivity in various day-to-day work activities, aiding in writing, information retrieval, and idea collaboration.
