# LLM Strengths & Constraints

Nowadays, LLMs applications could be easily seen in ChatGPT, Google's Bard and Microsoft's Bing and Copilot.

They could serve to diverse purposes, having a list of strengths and also some constraints.

One of the most important things, that we need to be careful is the **critical role of context** given to them.

## Fact-Checking

LLMs can quickly provide answers and information on a **wide range of topics**, but it is important to **verify their accuracy with reliable sources** due to the possibility of inaccuracies or **"hallucinations"**, and critically assess the content, especially in areas requiring specialized knowledge.

## Contextual Understanding

The ability of LLMs to adjust their responses based on the context provided by the user.

## Creative Assistance

LLMs can serve as tools for creative writing, helping to refine texts for clarity or even generate short stories based on specific prompts.

## Innovative Problem-Solving

LLMs can act as **"thought partners"** in brainstorming sessions, especially for unique or novel queries where existing web content is scarce or non-existent, like creating a coffee-infused pineapple pie recipe.

**Summary**

The versatility of LLMs and the cautioning of users is important to be mindful of LLMs limitations, particularly in areas requiring high accuracy or expert knowledge.

This balanced view encourages users to leverage LLMs effectively, combining their generative capabilities with critical thinking and external verification when necessary.
