# Tips For Prompting

Getting appropriate responses based on what you need from the LLM, is based on **creating concise and contextualized prompts**.

So, for creating effective LLM prompts, we could follow the steps below:

1. **Be Detailed and Specific**: Providing sufficient context or background information enhances their ability to complete tasks accurately.

    For example, when asking an LLM to help write an email for a job application, including details about your qualifications and the specific project can lead to a more compelling and relevant output.

2. **Guide the Model to Think Through Its Answer**: Structuring your prompt to lead the LLM through a thought process can yield better results. 

    An example given is brainstorming names for a cat toy, where the prompt includes steps for generating joyful words related to cats, finding rhyming names, and adding relevant emojis.

3. **Experiment and Iterate**: There's no one-size-fits-all prompt. The process involves starting with an initial prompt, evaluating the LLM's response, and refining the prompt based on the outcome to get closer to the desired result.

    This iterative process encourages starting with a clear but brief prompt and adjusting as needed based on feedback from the LLM's responses.
