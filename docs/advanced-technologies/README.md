# Gen AI Advanced Technologies: Beyond Prompting

To start talking about some more complex and advanced topics into Gen AI.

Let's delve deep into the fascinating world of advanced techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs).

We’ll start exploring Fine-Tuning, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and the role of *Pretraining* in enhancing LLM performance.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

In a few words, RAG connects LLMs to external knowledge sources through retrieval mechanisms.

For a deep dive, check out the [RAG](./rag.md) section.

### Fine-tuning

The mainly purpose is to **adapt** a pre-trained language model (such as GPT-3 or Llama 2) **to perform specific tasks**.

For a deep dive, check out the [Fine-tuning](./fine-tuning.md) section.

### RAG vs Fine-tuning

RAG and fine-tuning are not opposing techniques; they can be used together.

Both have their own benefits and are highly recommended for use.

While RAG leverages external knowledge, fine-tuning adds adaptability and refinement.

Fine-tuning corrects errors and ensures domain-specific performance.

The synergy of RAG and fine-tuning enhances model reliability and effectiveness.

### *Pretraining* LLMs

That’s another technique used for enhancing LLMs, but this one is not highly recommended because the amount of data needed to train these models, the expensive cost of training an LLM from scratch and the requirement of a large engineering team for several months to do the job.

It should be considered an option of last resort for specific applications and may be beneficial for only highly specialized domains with ample data.

An example of the usage of *Pretraining* LLMs could be seen on the creation of BloombergGPT, which shows better and improved performance than general purpose LLMs on tasks involving financial texts.

The best alternative for common scenarios should be the usage of general purpose LLMs in conjunction with fine-tuning and RAG approaches.

In summary, combining RAG, fine-tuning, and *pretraining* unlocks the full potential of LLMs, enabling them to perform well across various tasks while leveraging external knowledge and maintaining adaptability
