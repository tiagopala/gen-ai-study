# GEN AI Impact

As we could see, generative AI will have a broad impact on job roles and industry sectors.

Here are some key points to keep in mind.

## Impact on Job Roles

A study by *Eloundou* discovered that higher wage jobs are more exposed to AI augmentation or automation than lower wage jobs.

Higher wage occupations are more impacted in this wave of AI advancement, unlike earlier automation waves which affected lower wage, routine jobs more.

## Industry Sector Impact

Below it is a graph analysis made by McKinsey.

The vertical axis shows the total impact in billions of dollars, while the horizontal axis measures the impact as a percentage of the functional spend.

The yellow dots are the areas/sectors that will be heavily changed by the improvements and usage of generative AI.

> Just to point out, customer operations, sales, marketing and software engineering will see huge impacts in the coming years.

All of them combined, represents 75% of the total impact.

But, even if the total spend in some areas (like legal services) is smaller, the impact can still be considerable (e.g., 15-20% in legal).

## Key Takeaways

- **Knowledge Workers**: Generative AI will primarily impact knowledge workers who generate value through expertise, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills, as opposed to those performing physical tasks.

- **Opportunities and Concerns**: Generative AI offers numerous opportunities for individuals, businesses, and society but also raises questions and anxieties about future societal impacts.
