# AI Roles & Team Configurations

## Key Roles in Generative AI Projects

### Software Engineer

- **Responsibilities**: Writing and maintaining the software application.
- **Effectiveness**: A software engineer with basic knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and prompting can be highly effective in building LLM-based applications.
- **Recommendation**: Encourage existing software engineers to learn the basics of LLMs and prompting.

### Machine Learning Engineer

- **Responsibilities**: Implementing the AI system.
- **Effectiveness**: Machine learning engineers familiar with LLMs and advanced techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning are valuable.
- **Recommendation**: Machine learning engineers should learn about LLMs and advanced techniques.

### Product Manager:

- **Responsibilities**: Identifying and scoping the project, ensuring the application is useful for customers.

### Prompt Engineer:

- **Hype vs. Reality**: Despite media hype, few companies hire dedicated prompt engineers. Most companies expect machine learning engineers to handle prompting tasks.
- **Actual Role**: Prompt engineers often perform many tasks similar to machine learning engineers who have learned to prompt.

## Team Configurations

For small teams, a common configuration include:

- A machine learning engineer and a software engineer.
- A software engineer who knows prompting and a product manager.
- Two enthusiastic individuals with some software and prompting knowledge.

For larger teams, when possible it is recommended to have at least one of those additional roles:

- **Data Engineer**: Organizes and ensures data quality and security.
- **Data Scientist**: Analyzes data to guide decisions.
- **Machine Learning Researcher**: Develops or adapts advanced AI technologies.

> But remember, prototyping ideas is highly recommended to see if you can develop useful applications for your business.
