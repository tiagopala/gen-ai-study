# Identifying AI Opportunities

For a easier understanding, we will use a white-paper from the American Economy Association (AEA) called "What Can Machines Learn, and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy?" as a starting point.

This white-paper became kind of a framework for analyzing tasks within a business to identify opportunities for using generative AI.

Originally from economics, helps analyze work tasks for potential AI automation. But nowadays, due to its broader concepts, it could be expanded to other areas as well.

It’s useful for both understanding AI’s economic impact and identifying specific business opportunities.

## Automating Tasks vs Jobs

Before we get into the concepts, one big disclaimer here is the fact that Gen AI's focus is on automating tasks rather than steal jobs, as most jobs consist of multiple tasks.

Example: A customer service representative handles various tasks like answering phone calls, chat queries, checking order status, keeping records, and assessing complaints.

### Analyzing Tasks

Using the example above, lets identify the specific tasks that employees perform.

Assess each task’s potential for AI augmentation or automation.

| Activity                                     | Potential |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Answering inbound phone calls from customers | Low       |
| Answering customer chat queries              | High      |
| Checking status of customers orders          | Medium    |
| Keeping records of interactions              | High      |
| Assessing accuracy of customers complaints   | Low       |

## Augmentation vs. Automation

- **Augmentation**: AI assists humans with tasks. For example, AI recommends responses for customer service agents to approve or edit.
- **Automation**: AI fully performs tasks. For example, AI automatically transcribes and summarizes customer interactions.

### Evaluating Task Potential:

- **Technical Feasibility**: Can AI perform the task? Experiment by prompting an LLM to perform the task.

    Example: Consider if a recent college graduate could follow instructions to complete it.

- **Business Value**: How valuable is it to automate or augment the task? 

    Consider time savings, cost reduction, consistency, and other benefits beyond just cost savings.

## Application in Businesses

1. Use the framework to break down job roles into individual tasks.
2. Analyze these tasks for their potential for AI augmentation or automation.
3. Focus efforts on tasks with the highest potential for adding value.

## Beyond Cost Savings

Initial thoughts about AI often focus on cost savings through automation.
Historical innovations (e.g., steam engine, electricity, computers) show that while cost savings are a starting point, the **real benefits come from growth opportunities**.
**AI can lead to new ways of creating value**, potentially transforming workflows and business models.

### Revenue Growth / New workflows

Besides of the augmentation and automation of tasks, AI can lead to revenue growth by changing workflows in various industries.

Some hypothetical examples to illustrate it:

**Surgeon:**
- **Current Process**: Surgeons spend significant time on background research for medical procedures specific to a patient before performing surgery.
- **With Gen AI**: AI tools can reduce the research time, making the overall process more efficient while still requiring the surgeon to perform the surgery.

**Lawyer**
- **Current Process**: Lawyers gather information from clients, review complex legal documents, and provide feedback.
- **With Gen AI**: AI can speed up the document review process. For simpler documents, AI can make the review and feedback process more efficient. Lawyers might still need to verify AI outputs, ensuring accuracy before final client feedback.

**Marketer**
- **Current Process**: Writing website copy is time-consuming, followed by pushing it to the website.
- **With Gen AI**: AI can accelerate copywriting. The efficiency gained can be used to create multiple versions for A/B testing, leading to more effective marketing campaigns through improved analysis and iteration.

#### Value Creation

AI could also bring value creation, if used alongside your **customer tasks**.

By Identifying tasks performed by your customers and finding opportunities to use Gen AI to help them, potentially **leading to new product** or **service offerings**.

The key point here is understand the importance of **brainstorming and exploring different ideas** for **integrating AI into business processes**.
