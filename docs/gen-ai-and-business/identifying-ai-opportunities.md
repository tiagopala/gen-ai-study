# Identifying AI Opportunities

For a easier understanding, we will use a white-paper from the American Economy Association (AEA) called "What Can Machines Learn, and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy?" as a starting point.

This white-paper became kind of a framework for analyzing tasks within a business to identify opportunities for using generative AI.

Originally from economics, helps analyze work tasks for potential AI automation. But nowadays, due to its broader concepts, it could be expanded to other areas as well.

It’s useful for both understanding AI’s economic impact and identifying specific business opportunities.

## Automating Tasks vs Jobs

Before we get into the concepts, one big disclaimer here is the fact that Gen AI's focus is on automating tasks rather than steal jobs, as most jobs consist of multiple tasks.

Example: A customer service representative handles various tasks like answering phone calls, chat queries, checking order status, keeping records, and assessing complaints.

### Analyzing Tasks

Using the example above, lets identify the specific tasks that employees perform.

Assess each task’s potential for AI augmentation or automation.

| Activity                                     | Potential |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Answering inbound phone calls from customers | Low       |
| Answering customer chat queries              | High      |
| Checking status of customers orders          | Medium    |
| Keeping records of interactions              | High      |
| Assessing accuracy of customers complaints   | Low       |

## Augmentation vs. Automation

- **Augmentation**: AI assists humans with tasks. For example, AI recommends responses for customer service agents to approve or edit.
- **Automation**: AI fully performs tasks. For example, AI automatically transcribes and summarizes customer interactions.

### Evaluating Task Potential:

- **Technical Feasibility**: Can AI perform the task? Experiment by prompting an LLM to perform the task.

    Example: Consider if a recent college graduate could follow instructions to complete it.

- **Business Value**: How valuable is it to automate or augment the task? 

    Consider time savings, cost reduction, consistency, and other benefits beyond just cost savings.

## Application in Businesses

1. Use the framework to break down job roles into individual tasks.
2. Analyze these tasks for their potential for AI augmentation or automation.
3. Focus efforts on tasks with the highest potential for adding value.

## Beyond Cost Savings

Initial thoughts about AI often focus on cost savings through automation.
Historical innovations (e.g., steam engine, electricity, computers) show that while cost savings are a starting point, the **real benefits come from growth opportunities**.
**AI can lead to new ways of creating value**, potentially transforming workflows and business models.
