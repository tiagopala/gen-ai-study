# Generative AI and Supervised Learning

Generative AI leverages advances in AI technology, particularly in text generation through supervised learning. Here are the key points:

## Generative AI
The excitement around Generative AI stems from recent advancements, particularly in supervised learning and the development of prompt engineering, which is crucial for business applications.

## Supervised Learning
This technology enables computers to generate specific outputs (B) from inputs (A).

### Common Applications
- Spam detection
- Online advertising
- Self-driving cars
- Medical diagnosis
- Manufacturing defect inspection
- Speech recognition
- Sentiment analysis

## Evolution of Supervised Learning
The period from 2010 to 2020 was critical for the development of large-scale supervised learning, which laid the groundwork for modern generative AI.

The effectiveness of large AI models depends on the volume of data used for training.

## LLMs for Text Generation
Large Language Models (LLMs) are built using supervised learning, generating text by predicting the next word in a sequence. Training requires hundreds of billions to over a trillion words, enhancing accuracy and versatility.

## Summary
LLMs and other generative AI tools like ChatGPT can significantly boost productivity in various work activities, including writing, information retrieval, and idea generation.
